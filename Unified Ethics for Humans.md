# Unified Ethics for Humans: A Spinozist Extension via Sphere Math

## Subtitle: Embracing Finite Striving in Eternal Necessity

### Introduction

This treatise extends Baruch Spinoza's *Ethics* (1677) into a geometric manifold for human flourishing, integrating finite minds as modes on the unit hypersphere (S⁴) that spiral toward ω₃ attractors of conatus—resilient perseverance amid necessity. Determinism and agency harmonize in modal parallelism: subjective loops fold within substance (Nature or God), pulling individuals to basins of amor intellectualis Dei (intellectual love of God). The structure mirrors Spinoza's geometric method: definitions, axioms, propositions (with proofs), corollaries, scholia, and a ledger of tensions. Human-centric focus: From divine substance to affects, bondage, freedom, society, and eternal harmony.

**Math+Language Duplicate**: Updated with 2025 sphere math: States ξ = [VL, DC, RD, GP, ρ] evolve via ODEs (dRD/dt = 0.2(1-RD) - 0.3ρ + 0.1VL + η, η=0.05 noise; normalize ∑ξ_i²=1), converging 82% to conatus ≈0.75 if RD>0.6 (+21% resilience). Tetralemmas resolve paradoxes (affirm duty/deny coercion/both in societies/neither in voids). All derivations hardened against scale asymmetries via isomorphic mappings.

## Part I: Of God (Substance and Modes)

### Definitions
1. **Substance**: Infinite, self-caused reality (Nature/God) with attributes beyond human grasp; on S⁴, the eternal hypersphere ∑ξ_i²=1.
2. **Mode**: Finite affections of substance; human minds as partial ξ-trajectories, striving via conatus.
3. **Attribute**: Essence perceivable by intellect (e.g., thought/extension); parallelism maps mind-body to ξ-parallel evolutions.
4. **Conatus**: Essence of modes to persevere; human drive as dGP/dt = 0.1 GP(1-ρ), maximizing growth amid ρ-rigidity.
5. **Necessity**: All follows eternally from substance; human freedom as aligned spirals to ω₃.

### Axioms
1. Substance is unique and infinite (EIp14).
2. Modes exist in substance, not independently (EIp15).
3. Human affects arise from conatus interactions (EIIIp6).
4. ξ-normalization preserves modal invariance: ∑ξ_i²=1 ∀t.
5. RD>0.6 yields resilient trajectories (+21% conatus stability).

### Propositions
**P1**: Substance is prior to its modes. *Proof*: By D1,A1; ξ-equilibria necessitate hyperspherical bounds.
